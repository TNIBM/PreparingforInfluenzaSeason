# Preparing-for-Influenza-Season

## Goal
 To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics
 and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza
 season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will
 examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for
 staffing needs across the country.
 
 ## Business Requirements
 As ananalyst, you need technical skills to analyze your data and soft skills to communicate your
 insights to stakeholders. You’ll start by distilling business requirements and requests into questions
 you can answer with an analysis. You’ll follow up by sourcing and curating the data to address these
 questions. After analyzing the data and drawing conclusions or formulating recommendations from
 your results, you’ll present your insights to stakeholders in an easily consumable format.
 
 ##  Project Overview
 
 ● Motivation: TheUnitedStates has an influenza season where more people than usual
 suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
 complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
 adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
 staff.
 
 ● Objective: Determinewhentosendstaff, and how many, to each state.
 
 ● Scope:Theagencycoversallhospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
 the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

 ## Requirements
 ● Provideinformation to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing
 and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
 
 ● Determinewhether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal,
 does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
 
 ● Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-,
 medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
 
 ● Assessdatalimitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.
