# Preparing for Influenza Season

## Goal
 To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics
 and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza
 season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will
 examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for
 staffing needs across the country.
 
 ## Business Requirements
 An analyst requires a combination of technical skills to analyze data effectively and soft skills to communicate insights to stakeholders. 
 
 The process begins with distilling business requirements and requests into well-defined questions that can be addressed through analysis.
 
 The analyst is responsible for sourcing and curating the necessary data to answer these questions. Once the data is prepared, they conduct the analysis, draw conclusions, and formulate recommendations based on 
 the results.
 
 Finally, the analyst presents these insights to stakeholders in a clear, concise, and easily consumable format, ensuring the findings are actionable and aligned with business needs.
 
 ##  Project Overview
 
 ● Motivation: The  United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
 suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
 complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
 adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
 staff.
 
 ● Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
 
 ● Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
 the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

 ## Requirements
 
 ● Providing information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing
 and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
 
 ● Determining whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal,
 does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
 
 ● Prioritizing states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-,
 medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
 
 ● Assessing data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.
